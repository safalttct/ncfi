In Angular, you can bind a click event to a delete button within each table row, and use the splice() method to delete
the corresponding object from the array.

Here's an example:

<table>
    <tr *ngFor="let item of myArray; let i = index">
        <td>{{item.name}}</td>
        <td><button (click)="deleteRow(i)">Delete</button></td>
    </tr>
</table>

In this example, the ngFor directive is used to loop through the myArray and create a table row for each object. The i
variable is used as the index for each object in the array, which is passed to the deleteRow() function when the delete
button is clicked.

In your component:

deleteRow(index: number) {
this.myArray.splice(index, 1);
}

This function takes the index of the row as an argument, and uses the splice() method to remove the object at that index
from the array. This will update the table and delete the specific row from the table.

You can also pass the object itself to the function and use the same approach of JSON.stringify to find the index of the
object to delete

<table>
    <tr *ngFor="let item of myArray">
        <td>{{item.name}}</td>
        <td><button (click)="deleteRow(item)">Delete</button></td>
    </tr>
</table>

deleteRow(objectToDelete: any) {
let indexToDelete = this.myArray.findIndex(x => JSON.stringify(x) === JSON.stringify(objectToDelete));
this.myArray.splice(indexToDelete, 1);
}

In this example, the ngFor directive is used to loop through the myArray and create a table row for each object. When
the delete button is clicked, it will call the deleteRow() function and pass the corresponding object as an argument.

In your component:

deleteRow(objectToDelete: any) {
let indexToDelete = this.myArray.findIndex(x => x === objectToDelete);
this.myArray.splice(indexToDelete, 1);
}

<!-- using id  -->

This function takes the object of the row as an argument, and uses the findIndex() method to find the index of the
object to delete in the array. Then, it uses the splice() method to remove the object at that index from the array. This
will update the table and delete the specific row from the table.

Another approach is to use a property of the object as an identifier like id for example, then you can use findIndex to
find the index of the object to delete based on the identifier.

deleteRow(objectToDelete: any) {
let indexToDelete = this.myArray.findIndex(x => x.id === objectToDelete.id);
this.myArray.splice(indexToDelete, 1);
