This will display a warning to the user when they try to leave the page, asking them to confirm that they want to leave the page and potentially lose their data.

Keep in mind that this behavior may be ignored by some browsers, as it is not a standardized behavior.

You can also use the CanDeactivate guard to prevent the user from leaving the page until they have saved their changes or explicitly indicated that they want to discard them.
